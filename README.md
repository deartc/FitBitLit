  This project  compares 4 peoples' exercise data as they   prepare for the Kentucky  Marathon.
To run my project do the following: Go to github.com/deartc/FitBitLit.  Clone the repository.  Go to fitbitters.ipynb and use the Colab link to open up in Colab.
Run Colab to access data  that is updated. The Kaggle file KaggleFitbit can be accessed by clicking on Kaggle link and once opened up run it to update data.  Tableau can be accessed by clicking on the Tableau link. I used the following: pandas, matplotlib.
