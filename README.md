# FitBitLit
This is a  project named FitBitLit.  I  an  certified National Association of Sports Medicine Group Fitness trainer.  I want to use the project to compare various exercises.
THese current file downloads are test projects to see if I can use my knowledge from videos/class in a way that I could possibly I use exercise as a project. I realize sql file is not correct format but I just was testing if I could use in a project.   I plan on  a Kaggle file as data used for calories burnt.   I would like to also use at least one category of my own data in my project.  I plan to use Fitbit device and download the data. I started using downloads from my fitbit charge 4.    Although those are my ultimate goals,  I might have to limit my class project due to time constraints and specific class requirenments.  I plan on expanding it later after the course ends.  
I  plan on using Windows, SQL,Kaggle data, Colab, and Tableau, and possibly Jupyter.   To run my project your must do the following: Go to github.com/deartc/FitBitLit.  Clone the repository. 

 I satisfied the requirements by doing the following:
 
 
Gitignore used to keep  secrets/passwords used to access APIs / data sources out of the Github repository
Relevant packages that need to be installed to run the project include:


FEATURE LIST:
Category 1: Python Programming Basics:
Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.	
Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. The value of at least one object must be used somewhere in your code.
Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.
Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format.
Category 2: Utilize External Data:
Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application.
Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
Connect to a database and read data using SQL.
Category 3: Data Display
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.
Implement a data visualization in Tableau
Use a Jupyter notebook to document your data analysis 
Use Plotly or Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data
Category 4: Best Practices
Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.
Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.
The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file.
Source data should not be modified/changed - clean data should be stored separately.
Other features can be added to this list with mentor or staff permission, but we want to see you stretch your skills, so you’ll want to pick something challenging.

“STRETCH” FEATURE LIST:
These count too! But they will require going outside of the base curriculum to learn about and may be more challenging.
Implement a “scraper” that can be fed a type of file or URL and pull information off of it. For example, a web scraper that lets you provide any website URL and it will find certain keywords on the page.
Implement optical character recognition (OCR) that you can upload PDFs to and it will generate the text.

I satsified the requirements by doing the following:


Correct use of Git/Github and commits: I followed the correct steps in the project guidelines to create and name the github repository that would reflect a distinct repository. I then used the proper guidelines to initialize the project and add files using git bash and the command line. I then far exceeded the minimum number of commits needed to pass.

I also named my file a distinct name describing my project of FitBitLit.
