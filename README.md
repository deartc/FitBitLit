 This is a  project named FitBitLit. I want to use the   project to compare various exercises of people preparing for the Kentucky Marathon.
 
 Packages/Software Requirements:
To run my project do the following: Go to github.com/deartc/FitBitLit.  Clone the repository.
Colab should automatically run.  Tableau can be accessed by clicking on the tableau link.
 
Category 1: Python Programming Basics:
I built a conversion tool that satisfies the requirement of calculating and displaying data based on an external factor. I used the current date, and then displayed how many days remaining until some future date. I used the days until the Kentucky Derby Festival MiniMarathon/Marathon because those are conventional times for a person to monitor exercise progress. I wanted to use that also in the second requirement (a calorie counter).
 
I satisfied the requirement of creating a dictionary or list, populating it with several values, retrieving at least one value, and using it in your program. I created a dictionary that lists lower calorie exercises. The second dictionary had higher calorie exercise. I then had an intersection of the dictionaries of intermediate calorie exercises. I used this dictionary later in the program.
 
I also built a conversion tool that satisfies a requirement that converts the user input of one type (pounds which was used in another section of the project) to another type (calories) because I used calories in another requirement.
I also implemented a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address, is always stored and displayed in the same format at the start of my program. I used my email address and a web address and implemented a regex to ensure it was stored in the same format.
 
 
 
Category 2: Utilize External Data:
 
I used an Excel data file and included it in my project.  I used  Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data.
 

Category 3: Data Display
 
I used an Excel dataset of exercise data. I used  Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data.
I used an Excel dataset of exercise data. I used Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data. I also used Tableau to chart this data. https://public.tableau.com/views/ExerciseDataSetRevision/ExerciseDatatoReviseandClean?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

Category 4: Best Practices
 Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file. Create 3 or more unit tests for your application. The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file. Source data should not be modified/changed - clean data should be stored separately.
Not done yet but have basic code that might be needed.
