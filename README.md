# FitBitLit
This is a  project named FitBitLit.  I want to get in better shape and I am training for the Kentucky Derby miniMarathon.  I would like to use my Code Louisville project to inspire me.  I used a Kaggle file as data used for calories burnt.   I would like to also use at least one category my own data in my project.  I plan to use Fitbit device and download the data via Postman App.    Although those are my ultimate goals,  I might have to limit my class project due to time constraints and specific class requirenments.  I plan on expanding it later after the course ends.  
I  plan on using Windows, SQL,Kaggle data, Colab, and Tableau, and possibly Jupyter.   To run my project your must do the following: Go to github.com/deartc/FitBitLIt.  Clone the repository. ] 


I satsified the requirements by doing the following:


Correct use of Git/Github and commits: I followed the correct steps in the project guidelines to create and name the github repository that would reflect a distinct repository. I then used the proper guidelines to initialize the project and add files using git bash and the command line. I then far exceeded the minimum number of commits needed to pass.

I also named my file a distinct name describing my project of FitBitLit.
