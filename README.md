This project compares the exercise data of four people as they prepare for the Kentucky Marathon. To run my project do the following:
Clone github.com/deartc/FitBitLit. To run the Colab portion which lists the actual exercise data of my project, go to fitbitdata.ipynb and use the Colab link to open up in Colab. Once open use runtime tab then the option "run all" to update data.  Answer yes when prompted by this warning: "This notebook was not authored by Google."  If you wish to alter or use file follow the instructions listed. "Please make a copy of this notebook before using it. Go to Files > Save a Copy in Drive"
I used the following imported libraries: panda, matplotlib,sns, re datetime, datasets, and data_table in the project.  



The Kaggle file lists the weights of the exercisers and the potential calories burned by certain activities. The Kaggle file kagglefitbit.ipynb can be accessed by clicking on the Kaggle link and once opened up, run it to update data.

Tableau can be accessed by clicking on the Tableau link.  The four charts can then be accessed by clicking on the tabs at the top.



 Category 1: Python Programming Basics:


1.  Conversion tool displaying data based on an external factor: the current date, and then how many days remaining until some future date, the Kentucky Derby Festival MiniMarathon/Marathon.

2.  Dictionary or list, populated with several values, retrieved at least one value.

3.  Regex to ensure fields, a web address and an email address, are always stored and displayed in the same format.




Category 2: Utilize External Data:


1.  Excel data files
A. Data file cleaned B. Missing data addressed C. NAN values addressed D. Statistical analysis of data: Mean, Median, Mode D. Summary of relevant data files listed and analyzed E. Excel data plotted using matplotlib.


2.  Kaggle data  files 
A. Iloc Location of exercise in file used and identified B. Calories of four exercisers calculated with different exercise location and weight on Kaggle C. Summary and analysis of the data plotted using matploblib




Category 3: Data Display 

1. (Matplot Colab)
Matplot scatter diagram A. Excel data files scatter diagram of B. Histogram C. Correlation Charts D. Heat Map 


2.  (Matplot Kaggle)
 Matplot scatter diagram A. Data files scatter diagram  B. Histogram C. Correlation Charts 

3.  (Tableau)
