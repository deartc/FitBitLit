 This is a  project named FitBitLit. I want to use the   project to compare  people preparing for the Kentucky Marathon.
To run my project do the following: Go to github.com/deartc/FitBitLit.  Clone the repository.
Colab should automatically run.  Tableau can be accessed by clicking on the tableau link. 
  
 
Category 1: Python Programming Basics:
I built a conversion tool that satisfies the requirement of calculating and displaying data based on an external factor. I used the current date, and then displayed how many days remaining until some future date. I used the days until the Kentucky Derby Festival MiniMarathon/Marathon because those are conventional times for a person to monitor exercise progress. 
 
I satisfied the requirement of creating a dictionary or list, populating it with several values, retrieving at least one value, and using it in my program.
.
I also implemented a regular expression (regex) to ensure  fields, a web address and an email address, are always stored and displayed in the same format at the start of my program. 
 
 
 
Category 2: Utilize External Data:
 
Excel data files
Kaggle 
Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data.


Category 3: Data Display
 
I used an Excel dataset of exercise data. I used  Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data. I also used Tableau to chart this data.

Category 4: Best Practices  (will probably not do this one)
 Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file. Create 3 or more unit tests for your application. The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file. Source data should not be modified/changed - clean data should be stored separately.
 Notes:   Not done yet but I need to focus more on the data analysis before I focus on this
