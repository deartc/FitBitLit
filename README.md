# FitBitLit
This is a  project named FitBitLit.   I want to use the project to compare various exercises. 
Packages/Software:
I  plan on using Windows, SQL,Kaggle data, Colab, and Tableau, Jupyter, Anacoda, Excel and Spyder.  

Requirements:
To run my project your must do the following: Go to github.com/deartc/FitBitLit.  Clone the repository. 


(I'm not sure of what is needed here:

To run Colab do the following:



To run Tableau do the following


The following import commands should be used:  import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


 
 I satisfied the requirements by doing the following on the feature list in each category :
 

FEATURE LIST:
Category 1: Python Programming Basics:

I built a conversion tool that satisfies the requirement of calculating and displaying data based on an external factor. I used the current date, and then displayed how many days remaining until some future date. I used the days until the Kentucky Derby Festival MiniMarathon/Marathon because those are conventional times for a person to monitor exercise progress. I wanted to use that also in the second requirement (a calorie counter).



I satisfied the requirement of creating a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program. I created a dictionary that list lower calorie exercises. The second dictionary had higher calorie exerices. I then had an intersection of the dictionaries of intermediate calorie exercises. I used this dictionary later in the program.



I also built a conversion tool that satisfies a requirement that converts the user input of one type (pounds which was used in another section of project) to another type (calories) because I used calories in another requirement.

I also implemented a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and
displayed in the same format at the start of my program. I used my email address and a web address and  implemented a regex to ensure it was stored in same format.




Category 2: Utilize External Data:

I read data from an external file, a Kaggle file and used that data in my project



I used an Excel data file and included it in my project.  I used  Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data. 





Category 3: Data Display
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.
I used  Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data.   I used it on my Kaggle data to plot the exercise for my range.


I used an Excel dataset of exercise data that needed revison. I used  Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data. 
 I also used Tableau to chart this data.   https://public.tableau.com/views/ExerciseDataSetRevision/ExerciseDatatoReviseandClean?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link






Category 4: Best Practices  
Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.
Not done yet but have basic code that might be needed.





FEATURE LIST:
Category 1: Python Programming Basics:
Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.	
Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. The value of at least one object must be used somewhere in your code.
Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.
Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format.
Category 2: Utilize External Data:
Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application.
Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
Connect to a database and read data using SQL.
Category 3: Data Display
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.
Implement a data visualization in Tableau
Use a Jupyter notebook to document your data analysis 
Use Plotly or Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data
Category 4: Best Practices
Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.
Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.
The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file.
Source data should not be modified/changed - clean data should be stored separately.
