This project compares the exercise data of four people as they prepare for the Kentucky Marathon. To run my project do the following:
Clone github.com/deartc/FitBitLit. To run the Colab portion which lists the actual exercise data of my project, go to fitbitlitgit.ipynb and use the Colab link to open up in Colab. Once open, run to access updated data and answer yes when prompted.

The Kaggle file lists the weights of the exercisers and the potential calories burned by certain activities. The Kaggle file kagglefitbit.ipynb can be accessed by clicking on the Kaggle link and once opened up, run it to update data.

Tableau can be accessed by clicking on the Tableau link.  The four charts can then  be accessed by clicking on the tabs at the top .
I used the following imported libraries: pandas, matplotlib,sns, datetime, datasets, data_table,  re 


 Category 1: Python Programming Basics:


1.  Conversion tool displaying data based on an external factor: the current date, and then how many days remaining until some future date, the Kentucky Derby Festival MiniMarathon/Marathon.

2.  Dictionary or list, populated with several values, retrieved at least one value.

3.  Regex to ensure fields, a web address and an email address, are always stored and displayed in the same format.




Category 2: Utilize External Data:


1.  Excel data files
A. Data file cleaned B. Missing data addressed C. NAN values addressed D. Statistical analysis of data: Mean, Median, Mode D. Summary of relevant data files listed and analyzed E. Excel data plotted using matplotlib.


2.  Kaggle data  files 
A. Iloc Location of exercise in file used and identified B. Calories of four exercisers calculated with different exercise location and weight on Kaggle C. Summary and analysis of the data plotted using matploblib




Category 3: Data Display 

1. (Matplot Colab)
Matplotlib-Scatter diagram A. Excel data files scatter diagram of B. Histogram C. Correlation Charts 


2.  (Matplot Kagle)
