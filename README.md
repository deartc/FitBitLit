# FitBitLit
This is a  project named FitBitLit.   I want to use the project to compare various exercises. I plan on  a Kaggle file as data used for calories burnt.   I plan to use Fitbit device and download the data. I started using downloads from my fitbit charge 4.    Although those are my ultimate goals,  I might have to limit my class project due to time constraints and specific class requirenments.  I plan on expanding it later after the course ends.

Packages/Software:
I  plan on using Windows, SQL,Kaggle data, Colab, and Tableau, Jupyter, Anacoda, Excel and Spyder.  

Requirements:
To run my project your must do the following: Go to github.com/deartc/FitBitLit.  Clone the repository. 
To run Spyer do the following:

To run Colab do the following:



To run Tableau do the following


The following export commands should be used:


 
 I satisfied the requirements by doing the following on the feature list in each category :
 

FEATURE LIST:
Category 1: Python Programming Basics:

I built a conversion tool that satisfies the requirement of calculating and displaying data based on an external factor. I used the current date, and then displayed how many days remaining until some future date. I used a week in the future and the days until the Kentucky Derby Festival MiniMarathon/Marathone because those are conventional times for a person to monitor exercise progress. I wanted to use that also in the second requirement (a calorie counter)



I satisfied the requirement of creating a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program. I created a dictionary that list lower calorie exercises. The second dictionary had higher calorie exerices. I then had an intersection of the dictionaries of intermediate calorie exercises. I used this dictionary later in the program.



I also built a conversion tool that satisfies a requirement that converts the user input of one type (pounds which was used in another section of project) to another type (calories) because I used calories in another requirement.

I also implemented a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and
displayed in the same format at the start of my program. I used my email address and a web address and  implemented a regex to ensure it was stored in same format.

I also satisfied the requirement of creating and calling at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in the code. I determined how to calculate calories from pounds. I then calculated the calorie count for one week. I then calculated a bmi by weight (pounds) and height in the English conversion. I also did a metric version to satisfy this requirement of calling 3 functions or methods.




Category 2: Utilize External Data:

I read data from an external file, a Kaggle file and used that data in my project


I used an Excel data file and included it in my project



Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app.  I did that by using a fitbit. Note I'm still working on this.  I have in another private github 
repository with git ignore and it is private. I'm not sure best way to deal with it because haven't used git ignore before. 
I  have most of the coding done but if it creates problems will just not include in project.   






Connect to a database and read data using SQL.  Note:  I'm still working on it.  I got a basic Sql code down but I want to focus on making sure I get things in place to 
pass the project before refocusing on SQL.   








Category 3: Data Display
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.
I used  Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data.   I used it on my Kaggle data to plot the exercise for my range.


I used an Excel dataset of exercise data that needed revison.   I used Tableau to chart this data.  It is at this link.   https://public.tableau.com/views/ExerciseDataSetRevision/ExerciseDatatoReviseandClean?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

Category 4: Best Practices
Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.
Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.
The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file.
Source data should not be modified/changed - clean data should be stored separately.



I satsified the requirements by doing the following:


Correct use of Git/Github and commits: I followed the correct steps in the project guidelines to create and name the github repository that would reflect a distinct repository. I then used the proper guidelines to initialize the project and add files using git bash and the command line. 
I then far exceeded the minimum number of commits needed to pass.
Gitignore used to keep  secrets/passwords used to access APIs / data sources out of the Github repository
I also named my file a distinct name describing my project of FitBitLit.
