# FitBitLit
This is a  project named FitBitLit.   I want to use the project to compare various exercises. 
Packages/Software:
I  plan on using Windows, SQL,Kaggle data, Colab, and Tableau, Jupyter, Anacoda, Excel and Spyder.  

Requirements:
To run my project your must do the following: Go to github.com/deartc/FitBitLit.  Clone the repository. 


(I'm not sure of what is needed here:

To run Colab do the following:



To run Tableau do the following


The following import commands should be used:  import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


 
 I satisfied the requirements by doing the following on the feature list in each category :
 

FEATURE LIST:
Category 1: Python Programming Basics:

I built a conversion tool that satisfies the requirement of calculating and displaying data based on an external factor. I used the current date, and then displayed how many days remaining until some future date. I used the days until the Kentucky Derby Festival MiniMarathon/Marathon because those are conventional times for a person to monitor exercise progress. I wanted to use that also in the second requirement (a calorie counter).



I satisfied the requirement of creating a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program. I created a dictionary that list lower calorie exercises. The second dictionary had higher calorie exerices. I then had an intersection of the dictionaries of intermediate calorie exercises. I used this dictionary later in the program.



I also built a conversion tool that satisfies a requirement that converts the user input of one type (pounds which was used in another section of project) to another type (calories) because I used calories in another requirement.

I also implemented a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and
displayed in the same format at the start of my program. I used my email address and a web address and  implemented a regex to ensure it was stored in same format.




Category 2: Utilize External Data:

I read data from an external file, a Kaggle file and used that data in my project



I used an Excel data file and included it in my project.  I used  Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data. 





Category 3: Data Display
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.
I used  Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data.   I used it on my Kaggle data to plot the exercise for my range.


I used an Excel dataset of exercise data that needed revison. I used  Matplotlib to create charts/graphs of data. 
 I also used Tableau to chart this data.   https://public.tableau.com/views/ExerciseDataSetRevision/ExerciseDatatoReviseandClean?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link







Category 4: Best Practices
Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.
Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.
The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file.
Source data should not be modified/changed - clean data should be stored separately.


Not done yet but have basic code that might be needed.
